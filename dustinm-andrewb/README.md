# Code 301 Lab 06 AJAX and JSON and WRRC

**Andrew Bloom, Dustin Mundy**
**Version 1.0.5**

## Overview
1. We forked the lab 06 repo for this lab into Dustin's GitHub account. Dustin created a new branch and we started out with Andrew navigating and Dustin driving. When we switched roles during pair programming, Andrew fetched the working branch and pulled down the changes.
2. We first reviewed the User Stories and then reviewed the code in order to understand the structure and flow. Next we worked on going through each of the todo and comment sections and completing the todo's and commenting as necessary.
3. Last we worked on updating the README and completing any remaining tasks.

## Getting Started
To get started using this project, clone the repo down to your computer, and open up the index.html file in your browser.

## Architecture
The major change in architecture for this lab is the addition of AJAX. Using AJAX, the data is fetched from a file which stores all the articles as a JSON object, loads that into local storage, and renders the page based off of this data. If local storage exists, the data is loaded from there instead and the AJAX server request is skipped.

## Change Log
**No changes currently**

## Credits and Collaborations
Created by Andrew Bloom and Dustin Mundy. Based off of the starter code from the Code Fellows 301 lab repo. Using jQuery, Handlebars, highlighting.js, and marked.js libraries.
