# Code 301 Lab 05 Form Building

**Andrew Bloom, Dustin Mundy**
**Version 1.0.4**

## Overview
1. I forked the initial Lab 05 repo for this lab, cloned it down to my machine and then created the andrew branch.
2. I first reviewed the User Stories and then reviewed the code in order to understand the structure and flow. Next I worked on going through each of the todo and comment sections and completing and commenting as necessary.
3. Last I worked on getting the stretch goals implemented with the markdown rendering and code highlighting. This involved setting up some links in the html files, and passing the text of the body through the markdown conversion function in articleView.js.

## Getting Started
To get started using this project, clone the repo down to your computer, and open up the index.html file in your browser.

## Architecture
The major change in architecture for this lab is the addition of a form whereby a user can upload their own articles, and a page where they can preview that article.

## Change Log
